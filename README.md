Secure Device Update (SDU) Library
==========
The Secure Device Update (SDU) library is a software library to assist with device firmware or software updates.  The goal of this project is to make updating your device firmware in a secure way a minimal burden on device software or firmware developers.

The platform is available with full source code for all necessary firmware and support utilities, avoiding any vendor lock-in concerns.

For more about the background and motivation for this project, see the [release announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/announcing-secure-device-update-sdu-library-ota-through-dan-walkes).

Platform Support
-----
The SDU library is written in C with a design that it can be easily ported to support specific device platforms. Please refer to each platform page for instructions specific to each platform.

Please contact me at danwalkes@trellis-logic.com if you are interested in porting to a new device platform.
